"04/17/24|04/17/24||EDT|0|F|Y|Ann Arbor|MI|42.2754|-83.7308|OZONE||Good|No|FORECAST SUMMARY: Monday, April 15th, 2024, through Friday April 19th, 2024   PM-2.5: PM-2.5 concentrations are expected to be in the Good to low-Moderate range.  OZONE: Ozone concentrations are expected to be in the Good to low-Moderate range.  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  Riding the coattails of a beautiful Michigan spring weekend, provides us a great way to start off the work week with clear skies and high temperatures ranging from the high-50s in the Upper Peninsula to low-70s in some parts of the Lower Peninsula.  High-pressure dominates the Great Lakes region as we start off this Monday with the pressure system slowly moving eastward as Tuesday carries on. The next weather system arrives late Tuesday into Wednesday as a Low-pressure system moves in from the southwest, bringing an associated frontal boundary with it which will cool temperatures down midweek. The Low-pressure will also provide periods of rain throughout Michigan as it traverses the Great Lakes on Wednesday. We bounce back slightly temperature-wise on Thursday and Friday with yet another cold front making its way through the region Friday evening. This will drop temperatures back down near seasonal norms, but this pressure system will be lacking the precipitation that the midweek system will provide.   For air quality this week, in regard to PM-2.5, today the Department of Natural Resources announced there will be three prescribed burns across the Lower Peninsula. A smoke plume may be visible in these areas, but no lasting air quality impacts are expected. For the remainder of the week, multiple waves of changing airmasses will help keep PM-2.5 concentrations in the Good range, with some peaks into the low-Moderate range. Each day this week will be relatively breezy so this, too, will help keep stagnation at bay. Ozone does not look to be an issue this week either as we are still relatively early in the season where we typically do not see high Ozone concentrations. Although it has happened in the past, like last year with the earliest Ozone alert on April 14th, this week does not look to have the proper ingredients for Ozone to develop beyond the low-Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST: The upcoming weekend, as of now, looks to be dry as a High-pressure system moves into the region late Saturday, therefore overall air quality should remain Good.

This will drop temperatures back down near seasonal norms, but this pressure system will be lacking the precipitation that the midweek system will provide.   For air quality this week, in regard to PM-2.5, today the Department of Natural Resources announced there will be three prescribed burns across the Lower Peninsula. A smoke plume may be visible in these areas, but no lasting air quality impacts are expected. For the remainder of the week, multiple waves of changing airmasses will help keep PM-2.5 concentrations in the Good range, with some peaks into the low-Moderate range. Each day this week will be relatively breezy so this, too, will help keep stagnation at bay. Ozone does not look to be an issue this week either as we are still relatively early in the season where we typically do not see high Ozone concentrations. Although it has happened in the past, like last year with the earliest Ozone alert on April 14th, this week does not look to have the proper ingredients for Ozone to develop beyond the low-Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST: The upcoming weekend, as of now, looks to be dry as a High-pressure system moves into the region late Saturday, therefore overall air quality should remain Good.   Next Forecast update: Friday April 19th, 2024|Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy"

OZONE: Ozone concentrations are expected to be in the Good to low-Moderate range.  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  Riding the coattails of a beautiful Michigan spring weekend, provides us a great way to start off the work week with clear skies and high temperatures ranging from the high-50s in the Upper Peninsula to low-70s in some parts of the Lower Peninsula.  High-pressure dominates the Great Lakes region as we start off this Monday with the pressure system slowly moving eastward as Tuesday carries on. The next weather system arrives late Tuesday into Wednesday as a Low-pressure system moves in from the southwest, bringing an associated frontal boundary with it which will cool temperatures down midweek. The Low-pressure will also provide periods of rain throughout Michigan as it traverses the Great Lakes on Wednesday. We bounce back slightly temperature-wise on Thursday and Friday with yet another cold front making its way through the region Friday evening. This will drop temperatures back down near seasonal norms, but this pressure system will be lacking the precipitation that the midweek system will provide.   For air quality this week, in regard to PM-2.5, today the Department of Natural Resources announced there will be three prescribed burns across the Lower Peninsula. A smoke plume may be visible in these areas, but no lasting air quality impacts are expected. For the remainder of the week, multiple waves of changing airmasses will help keep PM-2.5 concentrations in the Good range, with some peaks into the low-Moderate range. Each day this week will be relatively breezy so this, too, will help keep stagnation at bay. Ozone does not look to be an issue this week either as we are still relatively early in the season where we typically do not see high Ozone concentrations. Although it has happened in the past, like last year with the earliest Ozone alert on April 14th, this week does not look to have the proper ingredients for Ozone to develop beyond the low-Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST: The upcoming weekend, as of now, looks to be dry as a High-pressure system moves into the region late Saturday, therefore overall air quality should remain Good.

"04/17/24|04/19/24||EDT|2|F|N|Benton Harbor|MI|42.1167|-86.4542|PM2.5||Good|No|FORECAST SUMMARY: Monday, April 15th, 2024, through Friday April 19th, 2024   PM-2.5: PM-2.5 concentrations are expected to be in the Good to low-Moderate range.  OZONE: Ozone concentrations are expected to be in the Good to low-Moderate range.  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  Riding the coattails of a beautiful Michigan spring weekend, provides us a great way to start off the work week with clear skies and high temperatures ranging from the high-50s in the Upper Peninsula to low-70s in some parts of the Lower Peninsula.  High-pressure dominates the Great Lakes region as we start off this Monday with the pressure system slowly moving eastward as Tuesday carries on. The next weather system arrives late Tuesday into Wednesday as a Low-pressure system moves in from the southwest, bringing an associated frontal boundary with it which will cool temperatures down midweek. The Low-pressure will also provide periods of rain throughout Michigan as it traverses the Great Lakes on Wednesday. We bounce back slightly temperature-wise on Thursday and Friday with yet another cold front making its way through the region Friday evening. This will drop temperatures back down near seasonal norms, but this pressure system will be lacking the precipitation that the midweek system will provide.   For air quality this week, in regard to PM-2.5, today the Department of Natural Resources announced there will be three prescribed burns across the Lower Peninsula. A smoke plume may be visible in these areas, but no lasting air quality impacts are expected. For the remainder of the week, multiple waves of changing airmasses will help keep PM-2.5 concentrations in the Good range, with some peaks into the low-Moderate range. Each day this week will be relatively breezy so this, too, will help keep stagnation at bay. Ozone does not look to be an issue this week either as we are still relatively early in the season where we typically do not see high Ozone concentrations. Although it has happened in the past, like last year with the earliest Ozone alert on April 14th, this week does not look to have the proper ingredients for Ozone to develop beyond the low-Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST: The upcoming weekend, as of now, looks to be dry as a High-pressure system moves into the region late Saturday, therefore overall air quality should remain Good.

"04/17/24|04/17/24||EDT|0|F|Y|Charleston|SC|32.8000|-79.9500|OZONE|46|Good|No|As of Wednesday afternoon, forecast regions Pee Dee and the Upstate are trending towards a code yellow finish while the remaining regions are trending towards a code green. On Thursday, the high pressure environment of this week continues to be the dominant factor. Much calmier winds and clear skies  are forecast throughout the day. Morning conditions look to be conducive for ozone precursor emissions. The atmospheric moisture level looks to be consistent with that of earlier in the week. A greater level of instability in the atmosphere and higher mixing heights for the region will promote some surface pollutant dispersion. However with this said, there is still the belief that elevated levels of ozone production will occur because of the many favorable conditions. Overall, forecast regions Catawba, CSRA, Midlands, Pee Dee, and the Upstate are projected to finish in code YELLOW, with the remaining forecast region Charleston Tri-County projected for a code GREEN finish.|South Carolina DHEC"

"04/17/24|04/22/24||MST|5|F|N|City of Maricopa|AZ|33.0589|-112.0469|PM10|45|Good|No|Updated Wednesday, April 17, 2024 **Ozone High Pollution Advisory – April 17, 2024**  A high-pressure system is expected to be present in our region this week warming up our temperatures before a weak weather system comes in this Friday with breezy conditions.  Yesterday, Queen Valley's monitoring site posted an 8-hour ozone average of 69 ppb, which is just two ppb from exceeding the federal standard. Today, we expect another day of light winds and clear skies, which will cause the ozone forecast to be upgraded to Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (USG) and an ozone High Pollution Advisory (HPA) to be issued.  Please note that ozone concentrations will be at their highest during the afternoon and early evening hours. Therefore, it is recommended that anyone with respiratory and/or heart ailments should limit outdoor activities during those times to reduce possible health impacts.  Apart from Hidden Valley, particulate matter in the air is expected to be in the Good AQI category today and tomorrow.  Have a great day!|Pinal County Air Quality Control District"

"04/17/24|04/17/24||EDT|0|F|Y|Detroit|MI|42.2330|-83.3330|OZONE||Good|No|FORECAST SUMMARY: Monday, April 15th, 2024, through Friday April 19th, 2024   PM-2.5: PM-2.5 concentrations are expected to be in the Good to low-Moderate range.  OZONE: Ozone concentrations are expected to be in the Good to low-Moderate range.  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  Riding the coattails of a beautiful Michigan spring weekend, provides us a great way to start off the work week with clear skies and high temperatures ranging from the high-50s in the Upper Peninsula to low-70s in some parts of the Lower Peninsula.  High-pressure dominates the Great Lakes region as we start off this Monday with the pressure system slowly moving eastward as Tuesday carries on. The next weather system arrives late Tuesday into Wednesday as a Low-pressure system moves in from the southwest, bringing an associated frontal boundary with it which will cool temperatures down midweek. The Low-pressure will also provide periods of rain throughout Michigan as it traverses the Great Lakes on Wednesday. We bounce back slightly temperature-wise on Thursday and Friday with yet another cold front making its way through the region Friday evening. This will drop temperatures back down near seasonal norms, but this pressure system will be lacking the precipitation that the midweek system will provide.   For air quality this week, in regard to PM-2.5, today the Department of Natural Resources announced there will be three prescribed burns across the Lower Peninsula. A smoke plume may be visible in these areas, but no lasting air quality impacts are expected. For the remainder of the week, multiple waves of changing airmasses will help keep PM-2.5 concentrations in the Good range, with some peaks into the low-Moderate range. Each day this week will be relatively breezy so this, too, will help keep stagnation at bay. Ozone does not look to be an issue this week either as we are still relatively early in the season where we typically do not see high Ozone concentrations. Although it has happened in the past, like last year with the earliest Ozone alert on April 14th, this week does not look to have the proper ingredients for Ozone to develop beyond the low-Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST: The upcoming weekend, as of now, looks to be dry as a High-pressure system moves into the region late Saturday, therefore overall air quality should remain Good.

OZONE: Ozone concentrations are expected to be in the Good to low-Moderate range.  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  Riding the coattails of a beautiful Michigan spring weekend, provides us a great way to start off the work week with clear skies and high temperatures ranging from the high-50s in the Upper Peninsula to low-70s in some parts of the Lower Peninsula.  High-pressure dominates the Great Lakes region as we start off this Monday with the pressure system slowly moving eastward as Tuesday carries on. The next weather system arrives late Tuesday into Wednesday as a Low-pressure system moves in from the southwest, bringing an associated frontal boundary with it which will cool temperatures down midweek. The Low-pressure will also provide periods of rain throughout Michigan as it traverses the Great Lakes on Wednesday. We bounce back slightly temperature-wise on Thursday and Friday with yet another cold front making its way through the region Friday evening. This will drop temperatures back down near seasonal norms, but this pressure system will be lacking the precipitation that the midweek system will provide.   For air quality this week, in regard to PM-2.5, today the Department of Natural Resources announced there will be three prescribed burns across the Lower Peninsula. A smoke plume may be visible in these areas, but no lasting air quality impacts are expected.

"04/17/24|04/17/24||EDT|0|F|Y|Eastern U.P.|MI|46.3456|-85.9453|OZONE||Good|No|FORECAST SUMMARY: Monday, April 15th, 2024, through Friday April 19th, 2024   PM-2.5: PM-2.5 concentrations are expected to be in the Good to low-Moderate range.  OZONE: Ozone concentrations are expected to be in the Good to low-Moderate range.  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  Riding the coattails of a beautiful Michigan spring weekend, provides us a great way to start off the work week with clear skies and high temperatures ranging from the high-50s in the Upper Peninsula to low-70s in some parts of the Lower Peninsula.  High-pressure dominates the Great Lakes region as we start off this Monday with the pressure system slowly moving eastward as Tuesday carries on. The next weather system arrives late Tuesday into Wednesday as a Low-pressure system moves in from the southwest, bringing an associated frontal boundary with it which will cool temperatures down midweek. The Low-pressure will also provide periods of rain throughout Michigan as it traverses the Great Lakes on Wednesday. We bounce back slightly temperature-wise on Thursday and Friday with yet another cold front making its way through the region Friday evening. This will drop temperatures back down near seasonal norms, but this pressure system will be lacking the precipitation that the midweek system will provide.   For air quality this week, in regard to PM-2.5, today the Department of Natural Resources announced there will be three prescribed burns across the Lower Peninsula. A smoke plume may be visible in these areas, but no lasting air quality impacts are expected. For the remainder of the week, multiple waves of changing airmasses will help keep PM-2.5 concentrations in the Good range, with some peaks into the low-Moderate range. Each day this week will be relatively breezy so this, too, will help keep stagnation at bay. Ozone does not look to be an issue this week either as we are still relatively early in the season where we typically do not see high Ozone concentrations. Although it has happened in the past, like last year with the earliest Ozone alert on April 14th, this week does not look to have the proper ingredients for Ozone to develop beyond the low-Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST: The upcoming weekend, as of now, looks to be dry as a High-pressure system moves into the region late Saturday, therefore overall air quality should remain Good.   Next Forecast update: Friday April 19th, 2024|Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy"

"04/17/24|04/18/24||EDT|1|F|Y|Eastern U.P.|MI|46.3456|-85.9453|OZONE||Good|No|FORECAST SUMMARY: Monday, April 15th, 2024, through Friday April 19th, 2024   PM-2.5: PM-2.5 concentrations are expected to be in the Good to low-Moderate range.  OZONE: Ozone concentrations are expected to be in the Good to low-Moderate range.  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  Riding the coattails of a beautiful Michigan spring weekend, provides us a great way to start off the work week with clear skies and high temperatures ranging from the high-50s in the Upper Peninsula to low-70s in some parts of the Lower Peninsula.  High-pressure dominates the Great Lakes region as we start off this Monday with the pressure system slowly moving eastward as Tuesday carries on. The next weather system arrives late Tuesday into Wednesday as a Low-pressure system moves in from the southwest, bringing an associated frontal boundary with it which will cool temperatures down midweek. The Low-pressure will also provide periods of rain throughout Michigan as it traverses the Great Lakes on Wednesday. We bounce back slightly temperature-wise on Thursday and Friday with yet another cold front making its way through the region Friday evening. This will drop temperatures back down near seasonal norms, but this pressure system will be lacking the precipitation that the midweek system will provide.   For air quality this week, in regard to PM-2.5, today the Department of Natural Resources announced there will be three prescribed burns across the Lower Peninsula. A smoke plume may be visible in these areas, but no lasting air quality impacts are expected. For the remainder of the week, multiple waves of changing airmasses will help keep PM-2.5 concentrations in the Good range, with some peaks into the low-Moderate range. Each day this week will be relatively breezy so this, too, will help keep stagnation at bay. Ozone does not look to be an issue this week either as we are still relatively early in the season where we typically do not see high Ozone concentrations. Although it has happened in the past, like last year with the earliest Ozone alert on April 14th, this week does not look to have the proper ingredients for Ozone to develop beyond the low-Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST: The upcoming weekend, as of now, looks to be dry as a High-pressure system moves into the region late Saturday, therefore overall air quality should remain Good.

"04/17/24|04/17/24||EDT|0|F|Y|Flint|MI|43.0146|-83.6959|OZONE||Good|No|FORECAST SUMMARY: Monday, April 15th, 2024, through Friday April 19th, 2024   PM-2.5: PM-2.5 concentrations are expected to be in the Good to low-Moderate range.  OZONE: Ozone concentrations are expected to be in the Good to low-Moderate range.  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  Riding the coattails of a beautiful Michigan spring weekend, provides us a great way to start off the work week with clear skies and high temperatures ranging from the high-50s in the Upper Peninsula to low-70s in some parts of the Lower Peninsula.  High-pressure dominates the Great Lakes region as we start off this Monday with the pressure system slowly moving eastward as Tuesday carries on. The next weather system arrives late Tuesday into Wednesday as a Low-pressure system moves in from the southwest, bringing an associated frontal boundary with it which will cool temperatures down midweek. The Low-pressure will also provide periods of rain throughout Michigan as it traverses the Great Lakes on Wednesday. We bounce back slightly temperature-wise on Thursday and Friday with yet another cold front making its way through the region Friday evening. This will drop temperatures back down near seasonal norms, but this pressure system will be lacking the precipitation that the midweek system will provide.   For air quality this week, in regard to PM-2.5, today the Department of Natural Resources announced there will be three prescribed burns across the Lower Peninsula. A smoke plume may be visible in these areas, but no lasting air quality impacts are expected. For the remainder of the week, multiple waves of changing airmasses will help keep PM-2.5 concentrations in the Good range, with some peaks into the low-Moderate range. Each day this week will be relatively breezy so this, too, will help keep stagnation at bay. Ozone does not look to be an issue this week either as we are still relatively early in the season where we typically do not see high Ozone concentrations. Although it has happened in the past, like last year with the earliest Ozone alert on April 14th, this week does not look to have the proper ingredients for Ozone to develop beyond the low-Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST: The upcoming weekend, as of now, looks to be dry as a High-pressure system moves into the region late Saturday, therefore overall air quality should remain Good.

On Thursday, the high pressure environment of this week continues to be the dominant factor. Much calmier winds and clear skies  are forecast throughout the day. Morning conditions look to be conducive for ozone precursor emissions. The atmospheric moisture level looks to be consistent with that of earlier in the week. A greater level of instability in the atmosphere and higher mixing heights for the region will promote some surface pollutant dispersion. However with this said, there is still the belief that elevated levels of ozone production will occur because of the many favorable conditions.

Wind speeds will increase above 10 kts as wind direction shifts to be primarily from the east. Temperatures will still be near 70 degrees on Wednesday as dewpoints rise to near 60 degrees. Skies will still be mostly cloudy. Wind direction will vary as wind speeds rise to near 20 kts. On Thursday temperatures will begin to decrease, with highs in the low 60's. Dewpoints will fall into the 40's and skies will be partly cloudy. Winds will be primarily from the west and wind speeds will fall below 15 kts. On Friday temperatures will continue to decrease, with highs near 50 degrees. Dewpoints will fall to near 40 degrees, wind speeds will continue to decrease, and there will be another chance of rain.  Air Quality model analysis and decision?    Ozone: Models show good ozone over the next few days. As rain and cloudy skies move through the region mid-week, ozone build-up will not be likely.  Fine Particulate: Models show good PM2.5 over the next few days, consistent with recent PM2.5 measurements. PM2.5 build-up will continue to be unlikely as rain moves through the region and as wind speeds pick up mid-week.

"04/17/24|04/17/24||EDT|0|F|Y|Grand Rapids|MI|42.8330|-85.5170|OZONE||Good|No|FORECAST SUMMARY: Monday, April 15th, 2024, through Friday April 19th, 2024   PM-2.5: PM-2.5 concentrations are expected to be in the Good to low-Moderate range.  OZONE: Ozone concentrations are expected to be in the Good to low-Moderate range.  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  Riding the coattails of a beautiful Michigan spring weekend, provides us a great way to start off the work week with clear skies and high temperatures ranging from the high-50s in the Upper Peninsula to low-70s in some parts of the Lower Peninsula.  High-pressure dominates the Great Lakes region as we start off this Monday with the pressure system slowly moving eastward as Tuesday carries on. The next weather system arrives late Tuesday into Wednesday as a Low-pressure system moves in from the southwest, bringing an associated frontal boundary with it which will cool temperatures down midweek. The Low-pressure will also provide periods of rain throughout Michigan as it traverses the Great Lakes on Wednesday. We bounce back slightly temperature-wise on Thursday and Friday with yet another cold front making its way through the region Friday evening. This will drop temperatures back down near seasonal norms, but this pressure system will be lacking the precipitation that the midweek system will provide.   For air quality this week, in regard to PM-2.5, today the Department of Natural Resources announced there will be three prescribed burns across the Lower Peninsula. A smoke plume may be visible in these areas, but no lasting air quality impacts are expected. For the remainder of the week, multiple waves of changing airmasses will help keep PM-2.5 concentrations in the Good range, with some peaks into the low-Moderate range. Each day this week will be relatively breezy so this, too, will help keep stagnation at bay. Ozone does not look to be an issue this week either as we are still relatively early in the season where we typically do not see high Ozone concentrations. Although it has happened in the past, like last year with the earliest Ozone alert on April 14th, this week does not look to have the proper ingredients for Ozone to develop beyond the low-Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST: The upcoming weekend, as of now, looks to be dry as a High-pressure system moves into the region late Saturday, therefore overall air quality should remain Good.   Next Forecast update: Friday April 19th, 2024|Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy"

Each day this week will be relatively breezy so this, too, will help keep stagnation at bay. Ozone does not look to be an issue this week either as we are still relatively early in the season where we typically do not see high Ozone concentrations. Although it has happened in the past, like last year with the earliest Ozone alert on April 14th, this week does not look to have the proper ingredients for Ozone to develop beyond the low-Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST: The upcoming weekend, as of now, looks to be dry as a High-pressure system moves into the region late Saturday, therefore overall air quality should remain Good.

OZONE: Ozone concentrations are expected to be in the Good to low-Moderate range.  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  Riding the coattails of a beautiful Michigan spring weekend, provides us a great way to start off the work week with clear skies and high temperatures ranging from the high-50s in the Upper Peninsula to low-70s in some parts of the Lower Peninsula.  High-pressure dominates the Great Lakes region as we start off this Monday with the pressure system slowly moving eastward as Tuesday carries on. The next weather system arrives late Tuesday into Wednesday as a Low-pressure system moves in from the southwest, bringing an associated frontal boundary with it which will cool temperatures down midweek. The Low-pressure will also provide periods of rain throughout Michigan as it traverses the Great Lakes on Wednesday. We bounce back slightly temperature-wise on Thursday and Friday with yet another cold front making its way through the region Friday evening. This will drop temperatures back down near seasonal norms, but this pressure system will be lacking the precipitation that the midweek system will provide.   For air quality this week, in regard to PM-2.5, today the Department of Natural Resources announced there will be three prescribed burns across the Lower Peninsula. A smoke plume may be visible in these areas, but no lasting air quality impacts are expected. For the remainder of the week, multiple waves of changing airmasses will help keep PM-2.5 concentrations in the Good range, with some peaks into the low-Moderate range.

On Thursday, the high pressure environment of this week continues to be the dominant factor. Much calmier winds and clear skies  are forecast throughout the day. Morning conditions look to be conducive for ozone precursor emissions. The atmospheric moisture level looks to be consistent with that of earlier in the week. A greater level of instability in the atmosphere and higher mixing heights for the region will promote some surface pollutant dispersion. However with this said, there is still the belief that elevated levels of ozone production will occur because of the many favorable conditions.

Yesterday, Queen Valley's monitoring site posted an 8-hour ozone average of 69 ppb, which is just two ppb from exceeding the federal standard. Today, we expect another day of light winds and clear skies, which will cause the ozone forecast to be upgraded to Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (USG) and an ozone High Pollution Advisory (HPA) to be issued.  Please note that ozone concentrations will be at their highest during the afternoon and early evening hours. Therefore, it is recommended that anyone with respiratory and/or heart ailments should limit outdoor activities during those times to reduce possible health impacts.  Apart from Hidden Valley, particulate matter in the air is expected to be in the Good AQI category today and tomorrow.  Speaking of Hidden Valley, the weather pattern this week will bring light southeasterly stagnation along with a temperature inversion atmosphere in the mornings. Therefore, the monitoring site's PM10 is likely to approach the Moderate AQI category this week, with some days being within the Moderate Dust Risk Scale (between 75 and 100 AQI)  Have a great day!|Pinal County Air Quality Control District"

OZONE: Ozone concentrations are expected to be in the Good to low-Moderate range.  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  Riding the coattails of a beautiful Michigan spring weekend, provides us a great way to start off the work week with clear skies and high temperatures ranging from the high-50s in the Upper Peninsula to low-70s in some parts of the Lower Peninsula.  High-pressure dominates the Great Lakes region as we start off this Monday with the pressure system slowly moving eastward as Tuesday carries on. The next weather system arrives late Tuesday into Wednesday as a Low-pressure system moves in from the southwest, bringing an associated frontal boundary with it which will cool temperatures down midweek. The Low-pressure will also provide periods of rain throughout Michigan as it traverses the Great Lakes on Wednesday. We bounce back slightly temperature-wise on Thursday and Friday with yet another cold front making its way through the region Friday evening. This will drop temperatures back down near seasonal norms, but this pressure system will be lacking the precipitation that the midweek system will provide.   For air quality this week, in regard to PM-2.5, today the Department of Natural Resources announced there will be three prescribed burns across the Lower Peninsula. A smoke plume may be visible in these areas, but no lasting air quality impacts are expected. For the remainder of the week, multiple waves of changing airmasses will help keep PM-2.5 concentrations in the Good range, with some peaks into the low-Moderate range. Each day this week will be relatively breezy so this, too, will help keep stagnation at bay. Ozone does not look to be an issue this week either as we are still relatively early in the season where we typically do not see high Ozone concentrations. Although it has happened in the past, like last year with the earliest Ozone alert on April 14th, this week does not look to have the proper ingredients for Ozone to develop beyond the low-Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST: The upcoming weekend, as of now, looks to be dry as a High-pressure system moves into the region late Saturday, therefore overall air quality should remain Good.

The next weather system arrives late Tuesday into Wednesday as a Low-pressure system moves in from the southwest, bringing an associated frontal boundary with it which will cool temperatures down midweek. The Low-pressure will also provide periods of rain throughout Michigan as it traverses the Great Lakes on Wednesday. We bounce back slightly temperature-wise on Thursday and Friday with yet another cold front making its way through the region Friday evening. This will drop temperatures back down near seasonal norms, but this pressure system will be lacking the precipitation that the midweek system will provide.   For air quality this week, in regard to PM-2.5, today the Department of Natural Resources announced there will be three prescribed burns across the Lower Peninsula. A smoke plume may be visible in these areas, but no lasting air quality impacts are expected. For the remainder of the week, multiple waves of changing airmasses will help keep PM-2.5 concentrations in the Good range, with some peaks into the low-Moderate range. Each day this week will be relatively breezy so this, too, will help keep stagnation at bay. Ozone does not look to be an issue this week either as we are still relatively early in the season where we typically do not see high Ozone concentrations. Although it has happened in the past, like last year with the earliest Ozone alert on April 14th, this week does not look to have the proper ingredients for Ozone to develop beyond the low-Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST: The upcoming weekend, as of now, looks to be dry as a High-pressure system moves into the region late Saturday, therefore overall air quality should remain Good.

First, a cold front is working its way across Indiana and will eventually stall near the Ohio River later today. In the meantime, warm air advection will allow highs to reach 80 today, with light west winds. Mostly sunny skies with increasing clouds late are expected. The frontal boundary will meander across southern Indiana and the Ohio Valley through Tuesday bringing renewed on/off chances for precipitation. Highs will be like today but expect breezy to gusty winds from the south southeast. A warm front lifts north over the area Tuesday night followed by a cold front on Wednesday. There will a very high likelihood of rain of Wednesday along with breezy to gusty conditions out of the west. Highs will be in the lower to middle 70s. Thursday appears to be brief break in the rain chances with mostly sunny skies and cooler highs in the upper 60s. Then a fast moving short wave moving through the flow on Friday may bring some showers to the area. Otherwise, highs on Friday will be in the lower to middle 60s and winds will be breezy.   Air Quality model analysis and decision  Ozone: The GA Tech model (36-km resolution/CONUS) is running one week old and was not factored into this forecast. The Firework smoke model did not show anything significant except for some residual smoke over the central (east-central) Plains. This should have no impact to the area. (Any residual smoke activity would be less than 5.0 ug/m3.) The Canadian model (GEM-MACH) is depicting Moderate for today which makes sense considering the high temperatures, light and variable winds and forecast persistence. So will most likely continue to go with Moderate for today. The rest of the period through Wednesday is either Good or just borderline low Moderate. Lastly, the NOAA model is showing Moderate for today and then Good for Tue/Wed for both for Indianapolis and Terre Haute, which agrees with the Canadian Model. Liking this consensus and it making sense for when the unsettledness starts for the period, so will be going Moderate for today and Good for the rest of the period. Even though there is a break in the action on Thursday, the area should be plenty cleaned out and the winds stay up.

Thursday appears to be brief break in the rain chances with mostly sunny skies and cooler highs in the upper 60s. Then a fast moving short wave moving through the flow on Friday may bring some showers to the area. Otherwise, highs on Friday will be in the lower to middle 60s and winds will be breezy.   Air Quality model analysis and decision  Ozone: The GA Tech model (36-km resolution/CONUS) is running one week old and was not factored into this forecast. The Firework smoke model did not show anything significant except for some residual smoke over the central (east-central) Plains. This should have no impact to the area. (Any residual smoke activity would be less than 5.0 ug/m3.) The Canadian model (GEM-MACH) is depicting Moderate for today which makes sense considering the high temperatures, light and variable winds and forecast persistence. So will most likely continue to go with Moderate for today. The rest of the period through Wednesday is either Good or just borderline low Moderate. Lastly, the NOAA model is showing Moderate for today and then Good for Tue/Wed for both for Indianapolis and Terre Haute, which agrees with the Canadian Model. Liking this consensus and it making sense for when the unsettledness starts for the period, so will be going Moderate for today and Good for the rest of the period. Even though there is a break in the action on Thursday, the area should be plenty cleaned out and the winds stay up.

"04/15/24|04/19/24||EDT|4|F|N|Indianapolis|IN|39.7490|-86.1860|OZONE||Good|No|Weather Forecast Discussion   This is shaping up to be an active period. First, a cold front is working its way across Indiana and will eventually stall near the Ohio River later today. In the meantime, warm air advection will allow highs to reach 80 today, with light west winds. Mostly sunny skies with increasing clouds late are expected. The frontal boundary will meander across southern Indiana and the Ohio Valley through Tuesday bringing renewed on/off chances for precipitation. Highs will be like today but expect breezy to gusty winds from the south southeast. A warm front lifts north over the area Tuesday night followed by a cold front on Wednesday.

"04/17/24|04/17/24||EDT|0|F|Y|Kalamazoo|MI|42.2747|-85.5883|OZONE||Good|No|FORECAST SUMMARY: Monday, April 15th, 2024, through Friday April 19th, 2024   PM-2.5: PM-2.5 concentrations are expected to be in the Good to low-Moderate range.  OZONE: Ozone concentrations are expected to be in the Good to low-Moderate range.  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  Riding the coattails of a beautiful Michigan spring weekend, provides us a great way to start off the work week with clear skies and high temperatures ranging from the high-50s in the Upper Peninsula to low-70s in some parts of the Lower Peninsula.  High-pressure dominates the Great Lakes region as we start off this Monday with the pressure system slowly moving eastward as Tuesday carries on. The next weather system arrives late Tuesday into Wednesday as a Low-pressure system moves in from the southwest, bringing an associated frontal boundary with it which will cool temperatures down midweek. The Low-pressure will also provide periods of rain throughout Michigan as it traverses the Great Lakes on Wednesday. We bounce back slightly temperature-wise on Thursday and Friday with yet another cold front making its way through the region Friday evening. This will drop temperatures back down near seasonal norms, but this pressure system will be lacking the precipitation that the midweek system will provide.   For air quality this week, in regard to PM-2.5, today the Department of Natural Resources announced there will be three prescribed burns across the Lower Peninsula. A smoke plume may be visible in these areas, but no lasting air quality impacts are expected. For the remainder of the week, multiple waves of changing airmasses will help keep PM-2.5 concentrations in the Good range, with some peaks into the low-Moderate range. Each day this week will be relatively breezy so this, too, will help keep stagnation at bay. Ozone does not look to be an issue this week either as we are still relatively early in the season where we typically do not see high Ozone concentrations. Although it has happened in the past, like last year with the earliest Ozone alert on April 14th, this week does not look to have the proper ingredients for Ozone to develop beyond the low-Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST: The upcoming weekend, as of now, looks to be dry as a High-pressure system moves into the region late Saturday, therefore overall air quality should remain Good.

This will drop temperatures back down near seasonal norms, but this pressure system will be lacking the precipitation that the midweek system will provide.   For air quality this week, in regard to PM-2.5, today the Department of Natural Resources announced there will be three prescribed burns across the Lower Peninsula. A smoke plume may be visible in these areas, but no lasting air quality impacts are expected. For the remainder of the week, multiple waves of changing airmasses will help keep PM-2.5 concentrations in the Good range, with some peaks into the low-Moderate range. Each day this week will be relatively breezy so this, too, will help keep stagnation at bay. Ozone does not look to be an issue this week either as we are still relatively early in the season where we typically do not see high Ozone concentrations. Although it has happened in the past, like last year with the earliest Ozone alert on April 14th, this week does not look to have the proper ingredients for Ozone to develop beyond the low-Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST: The upcoming weekend, as of now, looks to be dry as a High-pressure system moves into the region late Saturday, therefore overall air quality should remain Good.

"04/17/24|04/17/24||EDT|0|F|Y|Lansing|MI|42.7408|-84.5447|OZONE||Good|No|FORECAST SUMMARY: Monday, April 15th, 2024, through Friday April 19th, 2024   PM-2.5: PM-2.5 concentrations are expected to be in the Good to low-Moderate range.  OZONE: Ozone concentrations are expected to be in the Good to low-Moderate range.  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  Riding the coattails of a beautiful Michigan spring weekend, provides us a great way to start off the work week with clear skies and high temperatures ranging from the high-50s in the Upper Peninsula to low-70s in some parts of the Lower Peninsula.  High-pressure dominates the Great Lakes region as we start off this Monday with the pressure system slowly moving eastward as Tuesday carries on. The next weather system arrives late Tuesday into Wednesday as a Low-pressure system moves in from the southwest, bringing an associated frontal boundary with it which will cool temperatures down midweek. The Low-pressure will also provide periods of rain throughout Michigan as it traverses the Great Lakes on Wednesday. We bounce back slightly temperature-wise on Thursday and Friday with yet another cold front making its way through the region Friday evening. This will drop temperatures back down near seasonal norms, but this pressure system will be lacking the precipitation that the midweek system will provide.   For air quality this week, in regard to PM-2.5, today the Department of Natural Resources announced there will be three prescribed burns across the Lower Peninsula. A smoke plume may be visible in these areas, but no lasting air quality impacts are expected. For the remainder of the week, multiple waves of changing airmasses will help keep PM-2.5 concentrations in the Good range, with some peaks into the low-Moderate range. Each day this week will be relatively breezy so this, too, will help keep stagnation at bay. Ozone does not look to be an issue this week either as we are still relatively early in the season where we typically do not see high Ozone concentrations. Although it has happened in the past, like last year with the earliest Ozone alert on April 14th, this week does not look to have the proper ingredients for Ozone to develop beyond the low-Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST: The upcoming weekend, as of now, looks to be dry as a High-pressure system moves into the region late Saturday, therefore overall air quality should remain Good.

For air quality this week, in regard to PM-2.5, today the Department of Natural Resources announced there will be three prescribed burns across the Lower Peninsula. A smoke plume may be visible in these areas, but no lasting air quality impacts are expected. For the remainder of the week, multiple waves of changing airmasses will help keep PM-2.5 concentrations in the Good range, with some peaks into the low-Moderate range. Each day this week will be relatively breezy so this, too, will help keep stagnation at bay. Ozone does not look to be an issue this week either as we are still relatively early in the season where we typically do not see high Ozone concentrations. Although it has happened in the past, like last year with the earliest Ozone alert on April 14th, this week does not look to have the proper ingredients for Ozone to develop beyond the low-Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST: The upcoming weekend, as of now, looks to be dry as a High-pressure system moves into the region late Saturday, therefore overall air quality should remain Good.   Next Forecast update: Friday April 19th, 2024|Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy"

OZONE: Ozone concentrations are expected to be in the Good to low-Moderate range.  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  Riding the coattails of a beautiful Michigan spring weekend, provides us a great way to start off the work week with clear skies and high temperatures ranging from the high-50s in the Upper Peninsula to low-70s in some parts of the Lower Peninsula.  High-pressure dominates the Great Lakes region as we start off this Monday with the pressure system slowly moving eastward as Tuesday carries on. The next weather system arrives late Tuesday into Wednesday as a Low-pressure system moves in from the southwest, bringing an associated frontal boundary with it which will cool temperatures down midweek. The Low-pressure will also provide periods of rain throughout Michigan as it traverses the Great Lakes on Wednesday. We bounce back slightly temperature-wise on Thursday and Friday with yet another cold front making its way through the region Friday evening. This will drop temperatures back down near seasonal norms, but this pressure system will be lacking the precipitation that the midweek system will provide.   For air quality this week, in regard to PM-2.5, today the Department of Natural Resources announced there will be three prescribed burns across the Lower Peninsula. A smoke plume may be visible in these areas, but no lasting air quality impacts are expected. For the remainder of the week, multiple waves of changing airmasses will help keep PM-2.5 concentrations in the Good range, with some peaks into the low-Moderate range. Each day this week will be relatively breezy so this, too, will help keep stagnation at bay. Ozone does not look to be an issue this week either as we are still relatively early in the season where we typically do not see high Ozone concentrations. Although it has happened in the past, like last year with the earliest Ozone alert on April 14th, this week does not look to have the proper ingredients for Ozone to develop beyond the low-Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST: The upcoming weekend, as of now, looks to be dry as a High-pressure system moves into the region late Saturday, therefore overall air quality should remain Good.

EXTENDED FORECAST: The upcoming weekend, as of now, looks to be dry as a High-pressure system moves into the region late Saturday, therefore overall air quality should remain Good.

"04/17/24|04/19/24||EDT|2|F|Y|Ludington|MI|43.9553|-86.4525|OZONE||Good|No|FORECAST SUMMARY: Monday, April 15th, 2024, through Friday April 19th, 2024   PM-2.5: PM-2.5 concentrations are expected to be in the Good to low-Moderate range.  OZONE: Ozone concentrations are expected to be in the Good to low-Moderate range.  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  Riding the coattails of a beautiful Michigan spring weekend, provides us a great way to start off the work week with clear skies and high temperatures ranging from the high-50s in the Upper Peninsula to low-70s in some parts of the Lower Peninsula.  High-pressure dominates the Great Lakes region as we start off this Monday with the pressure system slowly moving eastward as Tuesday carries on. The next weather system arrives late Tuesday into Wednesday as a Low-pressure system moves in from the southwest, bringing an associated frontal boundary with it which will cool temperatures down midweek. The Low-pressure will also provide periods of rain throughout Michigan as it traverses the Great Lakes on Wednesday. We bounce back slightly temperature-wise on Thursday and Friday with yet another cold front making its way through the region Friday evening. This will drop temperatures back down near seasonal norms, but this pressure system will be lacking the precipitation that the midweek system will provide.   For air quality this week, in regard to PM-2.5, today the Department of Natural Resources announced there will be three prescribed burns across the Lower Peninsula. A smoke plume may be visible in these areas, but no lasting air quality impacts are expected. For the remainder of the week, multiple waves of changing airmasses will help keep PM-2.5 concentrations in the Good range, with some peaks into the low-Moderate range. Each day this week will be relatively breezy so this, too, will help keep stagnation at bay.

"04/17/24|04/19/24||CDT|2|F|N|New Orleans|LA|30.0660|-89.9310|OZONE|45|Good|No|Wednesday and Thursday, partly to mostly cloudy skies and scattered showers will reduce ozone formation over much of Louisiana. However, light to moderate southerly to southeasterly winds will bring thin-density smoke into the state from the Gulf, increasing particle levels in western Louisiana, especially. These conditions will lead to high-Good to low-Moderate AQI levels on both days.   Friday, as a weak front stalls over Louisiana, cloud cover will continue to limit ozone production over the northern portion of the state. However, light winds will limit dispersion, allowing pollutants to accumulate in Louisiana. These conditions will keep AQI levels high-Good to low-Moderate in most cities.|Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality"

Northeasterly surface flow, cloudy skies, and cool air will retain low values of PM2.5 and ozone.  ***  Extended forecast: A cold front passing through Friday night will bring showers with and well out ahead of it Friday afternoon and evening. High pressure building in over the weekend results in breezy and seasonably cool northwest surface winds. Air quality Friday into the weekend will remain in the good range.---McAuliffe|Pennsylvania Dept. of Environmental Protection"

"04/17/24|04/17/24||EDT|0|F|Y|Saginaw|MI|43.4196|-83.9495|OZONE||Good|No|FORECAST SUMMARY: Monday, April 15th, 2024, through Friday April 19th, 2024   PM-2.5: PM-2.5 concentrations are expected to be in the Good to low-Moderate range.  OZONE: Ozone concentrations are expected to be in the Good to low-Moderate range.  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  Riding the coattails of a beautiful Michigan spring weekend, provides us a great way to start off the work week with clear skies and high temperatures ranging from the high-50s in the Upper Peninsula to low-70s in some parts of the Lower Peninsula.  High-pressure dominates the Great Lakes region as we start off this Monday with the pressure system slowly moving eastward as Tuesday carries on. The next weather system arrives late Tuesday into Wednesday as a Low-pressure system moves in from the southwest, bringing an associated frontal boundary with it which will cool temperatures down midweek. The Low-pressure will also provide periods of rain throughout Michigan as it traverses the Great Lakes on Wednesday. We bounce back slightly temperature-wise on Thursday and Friday with yet another cold front making its way through the region Friday evening. This will drop temperatures back down near seasonal norms, but this pressure system will be lacking the precipitation that the midweek system will provide.   For air quality this week, in regard to PM-2.5, today the Department of Natural Resources announced there will be three prescribed burns across the Lower Peninsula. A smoke plume may be visible in these areas, but no lasting air quality impacts are expected. For the remainder of the week, multiple waves of changing airmasses will help keep PM-2.5 concentrations in the Good range, with some peaks into the low-Moderate range. Each day this week will be relatively breezy so this, too, will help keep stagnation at bay. Ozone does not look to be an issue this week either as we are still relatively early in the season where we typically do not see high Ozone concentrations. Although it has happened in the past, like last year with the earliest Ozone alert on April 14th, this week does not look to have the proper ingredients for Ozone to develop beyond the low-Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST: The upcoming weekend, as of now, looks to be dry as a High-pressure system moves into the region late Saturday, therefore overall air quality should remain Good.

First, a cold front is working its way across Indiana and will eventually stall near the Ohio River later today. In the meantime, warm air advection will allow highs to reach 80 today, with light west winds. Mostly sunny skies with increasing clouds late are expected. The frontal boundary will meander across southern Indiana and the Ohio Valley through Tuesday bringing renewed on/off chances for precipitation. Highs will be like today but expect breezy to gusty winds from the south southeast. A warm front lifts north over the area Tuesday night followed by a cold front on Wednesday. There will a very high likelihood of rain of Wednesday along with breezy to gusty conditions out of the west. Highs will be in the lower to middle 70s. Thursday appears to be brief break in the rain chances with mostly sunny skies and cooler highs in the upper 60s. Then a fast moving short wave moving through the flow on Friday may bring some showers to the area. Otherwise, highs on Friday will be in the lower to middle 60s and winds will be breezy.   Air Quality model analysis and decision  Ozone: The GA Tech model (36-km resolution/CONUS) is running one week old and was not factored into this forecast. The Firework smoke model did not show anything significant except for some residual smoke over the central (east-central) Plains. This should have no impact to the area. (Any residual smoke activity would be less than 5.0 ug/m3.) The Canadian model (GEM-MACH) is depicting Moderate for today which makes sense considering the high temperatures, light and variable winds and forecast persistence. So will most likely continue to go with Moderate for today. The rest of the period through Wednesday is either Good or just borderline low Moderate. Lastly, the NOAA model is showing Moderate for today and then Good for Tue/Wed for both for Indianapolis and Terre Haute, which agrees with the Canadian Model. Liking this consensus and it making sense for when the unsettledness starts for the period, so will be going Moderate for today and Good for the rest of the period. Even though there is a break in the action on Thursday, the area should be plenty cleaned out and the winds stay up.

The Canadian model (GEM-MACH) is depicting Moderate for today which makes sense considering the high temperatures, light and variable winds and forecast persistence. So will most likely continue to go with Moderate for today. The rest of the period through Wednesday is either Good or just borderline low Moderate. Lastly, the NOAA model is showing Moderate for today and then Good for Tue/Wed for both for Indianapolis and Terre Haute, which agrees with the Canadian Model. Liking this consensus and it making sense for when the unsettledness starts for the period, so will be going Moderate for today and Good for the rest of the period.

"04/17/24|04/17/24||EDT|0|F|Y|Traverse City|MI|44.7544|-85.6029|OZONE||Good|No|FORECAST SUMMARY: Monday, April 15th, 2024, through Friday April 19th, 2024   PM-2.5: PM-2.5 concentrations are expected to be in the Good to low-Moderate range.  OZONE: Ozone concentrations are expected to be in the Good to low-Moderate range.  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  Riding the coattails of a beautiful Michigan spring weekend, provides us a great way to start off the work week with clear skies and high temperatures ranging from the high-50s in the Upper Peninsula to low-70s in some parts of the Lower Peninsula.  High-pressure dominates the Great Lakes region as we start off this Monday with the pressure system slowly moving eastward as Tuesday carries on. The next weather system arrives late Tuesday into Wednesday as a Low-pressure system moves in from the southwest, bringing an associated frontal boundary with it which will cool temperatures down midweek. The Low-pressure will also provide periods of rain throughout Michigan as it traverses the Great Lakes on Wednesday. We bounce back slightly temperature-wise on Thursday and Friday with yet another cold front making its way through the region Friday evening. This will drop temperatures back down near seasonal norms, but this pressure system will be lacking the precipitation that the midweek system will provide.   For air quality this week, in regard to PM-2.5, today the Department of Natural Resources announced there will be three prescribed burns across the Lower Peninsula. A smoke plume may be visible in these areas, but no lasting air quality impacts are expected. For the remainder of the week, multiple waves of changing airmasses will help keep PM-2.5 concentrations in the Good range, with some peaks into the low-Moderate range. Each day this week will be relatively breezy so this, too, will help keep stagnation at bay. Ozone does not look to be an issue this week either as we are still relatively early in the season where we typically do not see high Ozone concentrations. Although it has happened in the past, like last year with the earliest Ozone alert on April 14th, this week does not look to have the proper ingredients for Ozone to develop beyond the low-Moderate range.   EXTENDED FORECAST: The upcoming weekend, as of now, looks to be dry as a High-pressure system moves into the region late Saturday, therefore overall air quality should remain Good.
